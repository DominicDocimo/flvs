# FLVS
A collection of my assignments for the FLVS Foundations of Programming Honors class.

A few things to note:
* It should be noted that this program uses an outdated version of Python (I believe somewhere between 3.0 and 3.5, 
I was never given a straight answer), meaning better methods could not be used.
* My methodology was limited by the constraints of the assignment rubric.
* My code is on my GitHub for the sake of adding it to my portfolio. Any students who are currently enrolled in the 
class may not use my code to violate any academic honesty policies.
